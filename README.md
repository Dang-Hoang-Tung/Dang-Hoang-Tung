# 👋 Hi, I’m Tony

I'm a full-stack engineer, more backend-leaning but I do enjoy working on everything.

## Projects

I've done some major projects in my previous work experiences, which I can only talk about. 
At the same time I've done some really cool personal/academic projects - some of which I've 
pinned on my profile.

Regardless, I feel like I don't have a lot of cool things to show off, so I'm trying to change that...

I have some ongoing projects, and to keep myself accountable, I'm putting them here.
