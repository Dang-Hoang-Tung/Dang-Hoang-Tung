# 👋 Hi, I’m Tony

I'm a full-stack engineer, more backend-leaning but I enjoy working on everything. I don't have a portfolio
website yet, that's TBD. I've worked on frontend, backend, APIs, databases, integrations, platform, CICD,
etc. Honestly there's not much to brag about, I'm still learning, but I think I'm a solid engineer who's able
to understand problems fundamentally well and create quality solutions.

## Projects

I've done some major projects in my previous work experiences, which I can only talk about. 
At the same time I've done some really interesting personal/academic projects - some of which I've 
pinned on my profile.

Regardless, I feel like I don't have a lot of "cool" things to show off, so I'm trying to change that...

I have some ongoing projects, and to keep myself accountable, I'm putting them here.
